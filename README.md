# Civil-War-Risk

The United States Civil War Strategy Game is a turn-based strategy game where players take control of different states and engage in battles to conquer enemy territories. The game is built using Python and Pygame library, and it simulates the dynamics of the Civil War era.

## Purpose

The American Civil War saw significant involvement from racial minorities, though their contributions are often overlooked or understated in traditional narratives. This project highlights the significance and contributions of minority racial groups in the Civil War. It is done by implementing key events which are similar to easter eggs that are unlocked when satisfying certain conditions in which the terminal will output an excerpt. Here are a few key instances where racial minorities played significant roles in battles in the project:

Battle of New Market Heights (1864): This battle, part of the Siege of Petersburg during the American Civil War, involved the United States Colored Troops (USCT), which were comprised predominantly of African American soldiers.

Battle of Fort Wagner (1863): Another engagement involving African American soldiers, the Battle of Fort Wagner took place near Charleston, South Carolina.

Battle of Honey Springs (1863): Native American troops, including those from the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek nations, fought on both sides of the conflict.
